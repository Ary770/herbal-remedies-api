You can search for herbs in the database that match specific medicinal uses like, headaches, colds, flu, anxiety, or by herbal properties like analgesic, antioxidant, stimulant, muscle relaxant, etc.

You can also see a list of the Top 65 Most Commonly Used Herbs and dynamically look at each herb's medicinal use, properties, preparation, and dosage.

To get it running locally, clone the repository. Run bundle install, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed and finally rake start to launch the application.
